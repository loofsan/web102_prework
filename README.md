## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the primary challenges I faced was implementing the filter and reduce functions. Since I hadn't worked with these concepts before, I needed to invest time in understanding their syntax and application. This process involved researching documentation and experimenting with sample code to grasp how to effectively use these functions in my project.

Another significant challenge was designing a modern, visually appealing interface for the app. I wanted the website to stand out and be user-friendly, but I had to work within the constraints of the available tools and technologies. Balancing aesthetic considerations with functionality required iterative design processes, feedback from users, and adjustments based on usability testing.
